I haven't made this process beautiful but it works 

1 - obtain distribution package from http://keith-wood.name/keypad.html
2 - unpack in "build" directory 
3 - run the ./build.me script to make your new vendor/*/* files
4 - run the ./tester script to create a rails app and test that it works
     n.b. the tester script is for my OS X machine, YMMV
